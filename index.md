<!-- Create a website about your favourite band using the HTML skills you have just learned. There's no need to do any styling (as we haven't learned it yet!)

Elements you should include on your site and page(s):

    A homepage (index.html) featuring a photo of the band and a brief description of the band (eg. how it got started, what genre of music, etc...)

    A discography page showing an ordered list of 3 studio albums (in order of release date) with a photo (album cover), title and track listing for each.
    A bio page showing an unordered list of the band members with photo, name and instrument/role of each. -->

    <!-- A nav bar with links to the 3 pages. -->

    A heading on each page to indicate which page it is. Homepage heading should be the name of the band, with a sub-heading saying "Tribute Site" or similar.
    Use emphasis on keywords

    A footer at the bottom of each page declaring your copyright on such a wonderful write-up, and make sure you use the copyright symbol!

    Your page should validate in this at this link: W3 Validator.

    Keep your code readabable and maintanable for your future self and future contributors.
